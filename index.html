          <p><strong>CRIMINAL DEFENSE / DWI / MISDEMEANOR / TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.</strong> You have rights that are guaranteed to you. Make sure those are protected at all levels. Among those rights are the right to remain silent, the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to have an attorney present during most questioning. It is important that you exercise and protect those rights and let your attorney speak for you! The criminal justice system can be challenging to understand and requires the help of an experienced advocate. Trust the attorney at Eastman Law Office to review the facts of your case and challenge the evidence at trial or negotiate a fair resolution.</p>
          <p>Some of the most vulnerable people are those facing misdemeanor charges in district court. You are often denied a public defender and you are at the mercy of the prosecutor or the judge. Any disruptions of your liberty or finances can have serious and long-lasting consequences to your job, your home, and your family. There are options for settlement of your case that you may not be aware of. We can help. Over the past thirteen years, we have helped hundreds of criminal defendants find both justice and mercy.</p>
          <p>You may think that hiring a good criminal defense attorney requires more money than you can afford. While a good attorney is worth his weight when it comes to protecting your liberties, it does not have to break the bank. We will defend you at a very reasonable rate.</p>
          <p><strong>FAMILY LAW.</strong> We have protected children from abusive situations, and helped parents gain or amend custody and visitation, establish paternity, and navigate through the frustrations of DHS interference. Adoptions, guardianship, grandparent rights, name changes, child support issues, and divorces are all actions that have required the competent services of an Eastman Law Office attorney.</p>
          <p><strong>CONTRACTS.</strong> We can also assist you in drafting sound contracts, or reviewing contracts you are contemplating. Do not overlook the fine details. Make sure your agreement is what you believe it to be.</p>
